# VLSI_HLS_PROJECT
This project involves high-level synthesis (HLS) of machine learning models for implementation on FPGAs. Each group will be assigned a model from a pool of 20 models, and the objective is to convert the model to C using Keras2C perform HLS using Vivado HLS, and compare results with the results obtained through HLS4ml.
